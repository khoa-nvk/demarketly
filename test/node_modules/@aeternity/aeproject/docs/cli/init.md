# Project Initialization

```text
aeproject init [folder]
```

_Optionally_ a `folder` can be specified for the project to be initialized in, otherwise the current directory is used.

Creates a new project structure with a few folders in which the developer can create **contracts** and **tests**, as well as installing needed dependencies.

## Update existing project
For upgrade from old AEproject versions check out [Migration from 3.x.x to 4.x.x](../migration-from-3.x.x-to-4.x.x.md).

```text
aeproject init --update
```

Updates the project structure and needed artifacts to the latest version, as well as installing needed dependencies.
